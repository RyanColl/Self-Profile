    <p>UxUi has always been a huge interest of mine. From a young age, whenever I would see logos that were
        on the side of busses or signs I would tear them apart in my head and tell myself what was good and what was not. 
    </p>
    <p>BCIT has now given me the opportunity and support I need to kickstart my self into the industry.
        My passion for design has become so much more now that I can create all of the logic for
        front-end and back-end designing.
    </p>
    <p>I have integrated my design skills in multiple projects throughout BCIT, which has 
        inspired me to take on more and more projects on my own, just so I can learn!</p>
    <p>Check out my <b><a href='' class='projects'>projects</a></b> tab if you would like to see more information about the things I am 
        currently working on!
